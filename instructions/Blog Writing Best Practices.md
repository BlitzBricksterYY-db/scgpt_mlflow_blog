**Blog Writing Best Practices**

1. **Hook your audience with a compelling opening:** You only have a few seconds to grab the reader’s attention so make every word count. Craft your headline and opening paragraph (maximum 200 words) to provoke — pose a question, identify a pain point or challenge an assumption.   
     
2. **Make it conversational:** Write as if you’re talking to a peer. Use the active voice, avoid formal language, acronyms and buzzwords. Use “you” in your writing (rather than talk about “Databricks” or “customers”) and don’t be afraid to use contractions (“you’re” vs. “you are”).  
     
3. **Watch the flow:** Compose an outline to see how each idea connects to the one before it. Ask yourself why the reader needs to get this information from you, not why you want to get the information to them.   
     
4. **Anticipate their questions:** Make a list of all the questions/doubts that your reader will have when they read your blog. Then make sure you answer every one.   
     
5. **Bullets are better:** Whenever you find yourself writing paragraphs that read like lists of things strung together, consider converting that content into a bulleted list. Bullets are easier to scan and help break up the content.

6. **Separate the post into subsections:** If you have a few different points to get across, separate the topics into different sections to make the content easier to read. 

7. **Don’t overlook the visual:** Incorporating visual elements, such as data visuals or UI images, within the article ​​provides a visual stimulus to the readers and makes the content more digestible.

8. **Wrap up with a great conclusion and a clear call to action:** At the end of your blog, always provide a quick summary of what was covered and leave the reader with next steps — read another blog, watch a webinar or sign up for our free trial are all common CTAs.

9. **Own it:** When you publish a blog, your name goes right at the top. So triple check your work for typos and mistakes — and ensure your writing aligns with our Style Guide.
